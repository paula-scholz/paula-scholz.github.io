## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cd.wiso.uni-koeln.de/en/team/personnel-economics-and-human-resource-management">Department Corporate Development</a>  at the University of Cologne and a member of <a target="_blank" href="https://c-seb.de/">C-SEB</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://econtribute.de/">ECONtribute</a>. 

My research focuses on topics in organizational, gender and behavioral economics. In particular, I am interested in inequalities in labor markets and organizations. To study these aspects, I conduct laboratory experiments as well as field experiments in close collaboration with firms.
